This is a very crude implementation of an assisted learning process which can analyse Linux logs and identify the best possible error.


The statistics part has not been implemented, but using a queue based ranking algorithm. Have to further refine this
with nltk.. To carry on this later..

1) written in emacs, so expected alignment problems..

2) Not the final piece but a sketch

3) basic idea is that the texts floser to the standard error messages in unix/linux have the highest possible option to detect an error.
